    Convert a SMILES string to an RDKit molecule object with standardization.

    This function performs several important molecular preprocessing steps:
    1. Parses SMILES string into RDKit molecule object
    2. Removes stereochemical information for consistent representation
    3. Optionally converts to Kekule form (explicit double bonds)

    Mathematical/Chemical Background:
    - SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a string notation
      for describing molecular structure using ASCII characters
    - Stereochemistry removal ensures consistent representation regardless of
      chirality specifications in the input SMILES
    - Kekulization converts aromatic systems to explicit single/double bond
      representation, which is often required for graph neural networks

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string representation of the molecule
        kekulize (bool): Whether to convert aromatic bonds to explicit Kekule form
                        Default: True (recommended for GNN applications)

    Returns:
        Chem.Mol or None: RDKit molecule object if parsing successful, None otherwise

    Note:
        - Returns None if SMILES string is invalid or cannot be parsed
