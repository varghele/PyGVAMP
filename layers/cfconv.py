class CFConv(nn.Module):
    """
    Continuous Filter Convolution layer as described in SchNet (Schütt et al., 2018) with optional attention mechanism.
    Attention mechanism and hyperbolic tangent come from GraphVAMPNet (Ghorbani et al., 2022).
    See also RevGraphVAMP: (Huang et al. 2024)

    This layer performs the following operations:
    1. Generates continuous filters from radial basis function expansions
    2. Applies these filters to neighboring atom features
    3. Aggregates the filtered features either through attention or summation

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_gaussians : int
        Number of Gaussian functions used in the radial basis expansion
    n_filters : int
        Number of filters to be generated and output features
    cutoff : float, optional
        Interaction cutoff distance, by default 5.0
    activation : nn.Module, optional
        Activation function for the filter generator network, by default nn.Tanh()
    use_attention : bool, optional
        Whether to use attention mechanism for feature aggregation, by default True

    Attributes
    ----------
    filter_generator : nn.Sequential
        Neural network that generates filters from RBF expansions
    nbr_filter : nn.Parameter
        Learnable parameter for attention mechanism (only if use_attention=True)
    use_attention : bool
        Flag indicating whether attention mechanism is used
    cutoff : float
        Cutoff distance for interactions
